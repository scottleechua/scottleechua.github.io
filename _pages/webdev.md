Occasionally, I develop small websites for friends and colleagues:

- [`myleyantay.com`](https://myleyantay.com) --- movie review blog
- [`andasproductions.com`](https://andasproductions.com) --- a project showcase
- [`lawrenceypil.com`](https://lawrenceypil.com) --- a writer's portfolio
- [`yamsmusic.com`](https://yamsmusic.com) --- a musician's page

#### tech stack

**Engine.** I usually use [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) when email or search is important, and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) otherwise.

**Editor interface.** Ghost has its own delightful editor interface. For Jekyll, I've started using [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/), which cleverly generates a Wordpress-esque editor interface for static sites right in the browser.

**Monitoring.** I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for ethical, privacy-minded analytics, and [Betterstack](https://betterstack.com/)'s free tier for uptime checks.

#### resources

- For Ghost, read my blog post [Self-hosting Ghost on Google Cloud](/blog/self-hosting-ghost-on-google-cloud).
- For TinaCMS with Jekyll, clone my starter template [`tina-ghpages-starter`](https://github.com/scottleechua/tina-ghpages-starter).
