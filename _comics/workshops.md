In July 2022, I was invited to run a writing workshop for grade school students at the [Scholastic Readers Camp](https://www.scholastic.asia/), a wonderful annual event meant to cultivate a culture of reading.

After sharing a bit about my own journey as a reader and writer, I led the participants through the process of making their very own comics. Inspired by Sarah Mirk's [zine-making workshop](https://www.mirkwork.com/speaking), we each folded, wrote, and drew an eight-page comic booklet! I had lots of fun listening to the participants share their stories.

In February 2021, I was invited back to my alma mater to run a workshop as part of their Comics and Zines Fest. The goal was to teach aspiring comic writers the basic elements of sequential storytelling, so that they could better articulate why a comic is (or isn't) working, and improve their craft in a more systematic way.

Zoom is wonderful for many things, but free-flowing discussion is not one of them. So I asked participants to pre-read some comic excerpts and respond to them however they like, as articulately as they could. I then synthesize their responses into a guided close reading of sorts for the workshop session itself --- see what we cooked up [here](/assets/pdf/page1_panel1_workshop_scottleechua.pdf).

In March 2018, I gave a talk to the eighth-grade students of Xavier School (my other alma mater!) together with Lio Mangubat, editor-in-chief of Summit Books and the publisher of *Doorkeeper*. We had a great time talking about our favorite comics, the publishing process, and the false dichotomy between "highbrow" and "lowbrow" entertainment --- see our slides [here](/assets/pdf/xavier_comic_conference_scottleechua.pdf).
